# Baker's Oven
## A Simple hpub Generator

Baker's Oven generates HTML and CSS with a Padrino based application. This gives
us the ability to use HAML, SASS, partials and layouts. At some point I may also
build a simple database interface to allow non-technical people to add pages.

## Installation

-- from oven dir --
$ bundle install

-- during development --
$ padrino start 

## Deployment

When ready to deploy, rake tasks are available to generate static html files and 
stylesheets. 


$ rake clean  

Remove all of the book files

$ rake build

Build all of the book files in the book/ dir

$ rake compile

Cleans, builds, then zips into an hpub and moves to pkg/ dir

$ rake deploy

If set up, can deploy your latest hpub to your server with rsync. Compiles a fresh
copy beforehand.
